Description: Perform calculations concurently in the 
background thereby freeing the R
console to perform other tasks.  The package currently supports a sequential
backend, where the calculation is evaluted when it is brought into the
foreground along with a multicore backend, where the calculation is started
immediately after it is backgrounded.  Other packages, such as 
multicore.background can be used for true process backgrounding.
