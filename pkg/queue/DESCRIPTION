Description: A queue is a sequential data structure allowing users
  to push to the back of it to store data and pull from the front of it
  to retrieve data.  The queue data structure provided in this package
  is appropriate for use on a single-process R session.  However,
  there are other packages, such as redis.queue, that allow data
  structures to be passed between processes.
